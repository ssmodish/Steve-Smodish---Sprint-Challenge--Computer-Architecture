the above look like they are programs that will run on our emulator when completed.

cpu.c:
    cpu_load: hard coded program for first day MVP
    alu: ?
    cpu_run: the main functional loop of the system
    cpu_init: initialize a cpu struct

cpu.h:
    struct cpu: defines the cpu struct
    enum alu_op: ?
    defines global constants (commands)
    defines shapes of functions in cpu.c

ls8.c:
    runs the ls8 emulator

Makefile:
    builds our program

README.md:
    Instructions for the project


ls8 spec suggests `FL` is another register - not sure what this is yet
